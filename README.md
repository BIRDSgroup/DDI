# Double-disease-interaction-analysis

This repository contains codes, scripts, and data to replicate the results in our paper (cite).
We also provide a generalized function called **"MI_func"** (check the "functions" folder) which can be applied to any double disease conditions (provided necessary cohorts are available).

This file has been separated into four sections to facilitate navigating the repository.

1. **Replicating the results**
2. **Dissecting the scripts**
3. **Figures, Supplementary Figures, and Supplementary Tables**
4. **Functions**
5. **Data**

## Section - 1 - Replicating the results 

There are three main scripts in this section. Running these scripts with slight modifications in the working directory will replicate the results from our work.

1. **MI_script.R** 
2. **Validation_script.R**
3. **Interpretation_script.R**
