# Double-disease-interaction-analysis

This is the official repository of the paper "Systems analysis of multiple diabetes-helminth cohorts reveals
markers of disease-disease interaction" by Nilesh Subramanian, Philge Philip, Anuradha Rajamanickam, Nathella Pavan
Kumar, Subash Babu, and Manikandan Narayanan.


This repository contains two sections:

1. DDI pipeline
2. Application of our DDI pipeline on the Helminth-diabetes dataset 

## Section 1: DDI pipeline

This repository contains codes, scripts, and data to replicate the results in our paper (cite).
We also provide a generalized function called **"MI_func"** (check the "functions" folder) which can be applied to any double disease conditions (provided necessary cohorts are available).

This file has been separated into four sections to facilitate navigating the repository.

1. **Replicating the results**
2. **Dissecting the scripts**
3. **Figures, Supplementary Figures, and Supplementary Tables**
4. **Functions**
5. **Data**

## Section - 1 - Replicating the results 

There are three main scripts in this section. Running these scripts with slight modifications in the working directory will replicate the results from our work.<br>
**Details on the output generated from each of these scripts are given in the README files in each of their folders.**
1. **MI_script.R** 
2. **Validation_script.R**
3. **Interpretation_script.R**

## Section - 2 - Figures, Supplementary Figures, and Supplementary Tables
