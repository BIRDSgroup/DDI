# Double-disease-interaction-analysis

This repository contains codes, scripts, data to replicate the results in our paper (cite)
We also provide a generalised function called "MI_func" which can be applied to any double disease conditions (provided necessary cohorts are available).
To facilitate navigating the repository, this file has been separated into four sections.
1. Replicating the results
2. Dissecting the scripts
3. Functions
## Section - 1 - Replicating the results
